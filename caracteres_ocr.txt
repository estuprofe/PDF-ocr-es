the most contributions were original articles (42%) and theme 



nurses predominate (74%); with graduate formation (71%); with 



(70%). The principal themes dealt with are: nursing care (24%), 

nursing education and formation (14%), nursing practice (6%), 

and nursing history (5%). The most frequent populations objects 

of study are nurses (25%) and nursing students (8%). A total of 

15% deal with vulnerable populations (elderly, children, pregnant 

women, the handicapped, and individuals from rural areas, 

among others). Additionally, the following tendencies were noted: 

authors have improved in their levels of formation, and regarding 
the increased number of original articles and balance per type 
of research paradigm. . Author™s characteristics and 
thematic preferences, along with populations object of the articles 
show that progress has been produced in divulging knowledge 

generated and of the experiences in their implementation in nursing 
practice, thus, contributing to the discipline™s development.

greater strength and notoriety.
1 For Nursing, the 
dissemination and use of knowledge in practice 

are necessary for growth in this profession.

comply with said purposes, it is necessary for said 

knowledge to be divulged through its publication

medium to communicate progress reached in the

of knowledge has increased notably through 



has improved understanding of the perspectives 

of care in the world.5 The increased number of 
nursing journals has been so high
6 that in the most specialized database in the discipline, Cumulative 
Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), 
we could consult 5089 journals in April 2013.7 However, Nursing, as the young science it is, 

requires evaluating what is being published
8 to 
identify what are the study phenomena of interest 

for nursing professionals, in what populations are 

the greatest research efforts being concentrated, 



addressed.2Because of this, it is necessary to study the written 

production in journals to characterize and identify 

the tendencies in publications in Nursing, besides 

exploring its relationship with the disciplinary 

development. In Iberian America, Spain2,9-11 and Brazil4,6,12 are the countries with the highest 
interest for these types of evaluations, which is 

noted in the number of articles published on this 

theme in recent years. On the contrary, Colombia 

has very low diffusion Œ the bibliographic search 



production published between 2002 and 2007 

in the journal

 and in 
the Latin American journal by 
Enfermagem.13 Other articles jointly analyzed journals, research 

reports, and theses work,

nursing journals regarding the availability and 

functionality of their web page.16 The journal object of this study, 
Investigación y 
Educación en Enfermería
 (IEE), is a publication 
from the Faculty of Nursing at Universidad de 

Antioquia whose mission is the publication of 

progress in research and education that contributes 
to the development of the discipline. This journal 

was created in 1983 due to the need to have a 
written medium in which to publish results of 

research carried out by nursing personnel.17 Over time, IEE accommodated itself to increasingly 



publications to acknowledge their quality, and 

from national and international organisms, 

leading to its indexing in COLCIENCIAS™ IBN-

concepts. Having a web page since 2010 for 

consultation of abstracts and for the possibility 

of reading and freely downloading articles in 

complete text, increased its visibility, while 

offering the availability of tools for on-line editorial 
management for submission, referee evaluation, 

and author follow up of articles. This is how by 



of 121 manuscripts submitted, which were 

subjected to the editorial process for approval 

study. 
From 1983 to December 2012, 63 numbers were 
edited with 656 articles compiled. Although the 

IEE journal has been published without interruption 
for 30 years, a study had not been conducted on

therein, which is why this research will contribute 

with this description. Additionally, information 

will be available on the tendencies over time, the 

particularities of their authors, and on the type, 

themes, and population of study of the articles 



to conduct the work with the aim of characterizing

documentary-type, descriptive, 
quantitative, longitudinal, and retrospective study. 
All the articles published in the IEE journal, since 


2012, were the target population.

case study, structured surveys, other.
To gather information, a manual revision was 
conducted of all the articles by the researchers. 
The data gathered were digitized onto a database designed in the SPSS program (version 21). Statistical analysis was performed in the same 
program, consisting in: a) univariate analysis: for variables at rate level average and standard deviation were estimated; for variables measured 

at nominal and ordinal levels absolute and relative 
frequencies were calculated; b) bivariate analysis: 
explored some relations among variables of interest by applying the following tests: Pearson 
correlation,

was observed toward the increase of manuscripts 

published annually, especially of original articles, 

which agrees with other authors
10,19 who state 
that knowledge in nursing has had exponential 

growth in recent years. The increased number of 

articles published in this journal is also due to 

three reasons: three numbers are edited per year 

since 2010, a platform is available on the web 
page for submittal and follow-up of manuscripts, 

and Œ further Œ since 2012 the journal is published 

entirely in English, which promotes receiving 

articles from any part of the world.

one of the most important because it accounts to

42% of the production during its 30 years was 

of original articles, a higher proportion than that 

reported by Serrano 
et al.,10 in a similar study of a 
Spanish journal where these articles reached 22%. 
During the development of the IEE journal, a 


theme reviews predominated; during the second, 

essays; and during the third, original articles. This 

is explained by the change in global tendencies in 

production and publication of knowledge in the 

last half century,
3,22 which are priorities related to 
the components of innovation and development 
for which it is essential to conduct research.Regarding the number of references, in our 
journal we observed an increasing tendency

reported by an article comparing the production of 

a Brazilian journal to that of another Colombian 

journal,13 which commented that nurses offering 


research. Other authors10,24 state that it is the result 
of the pressure of universities on their faculty staff to 

publish research results. It is also a fact that most 

nursing journals come from academic institutions 

and few are from hospital entities. Although many 

healthcare institutions have teaching-care provider 

agreements with universities, these rarely have 

institutional policies for research,16 which explains 


is due mainly to formation institutions.25 Other 
authors8,13 remark on the need to involve care 
providing nurses in research processes, given that 

they are the ones who are frequently in contact 

with the users, thereby, they should not waste 

their valuable contributions and experience on the 

practice of care. 
With respect to the average number of authors 
per article, it was found that almost half of those 

published in IEE had one author, observing over 

time the tendency to increasing from two to three. 

The aforementioned has also been reported in 

studies in journals from Spain,
9-11 Italy,
24 and Colombia and Brazil;13 which Harande26 has interpreted as a possible direct relationship with 



research that leads to articles and which Serrano
10 has associated to the increased complexity of 

research.Revising the academic level of the authors in the 


of articles in the IEE journal have had graduate 

formation (39% masters and 21% doctorate), 

et al.,8 who also stated publications by nurses with master™s degree is higher because those with 

PhD degrees are still a minority. Díaz 
et al.,13 state that this difference may be because many 

of the authors are professors who are required 

higher academic formation to work in universities 

and, as already expressed, they have the greatest 

commitment to divulge research results.María de los Ángeles Rodríguez-arley Mateo Rojas-Minota
Invest Educ Enferm. 2013;31(3) 351
4% of the articles published in the IEE journal, a 

participation that, according to García 
et al
.,8 is 
quite limited and could be a consequence of low 

commitment in the promotion of new generations 
of researchers.Upon revising the themes of the articles, our journal 
revealed that out of every four articles one dealt 

with nursing care and another with public health. 

The aforementioned is similar to data reported 
in articles on journals from Spain,
2,10 Italy,
24 England,19 and two Latin American journals.13 Prado 
et al
.,27 found, in a study conducted with 
Brazilian and Spanish publications, that the most-addressed themes were those related to education 


that was similar in our study. A theme of emerging 
interest, like that of theories of nursing, has been 


et al.,13 a situation that could also be assumed in our study 
where only 0.5% of the articles had this topic.
Nurses were the most-frequent target population of the article (25%), followed by nursing students 

(8%). Several authors
2,19,20 have also reported that 
the volume of articles is important in which the 

target population of study are these professionals, 
revealing that it is the nursing profession is the 
self-reference of what is published. Díaz 
et al
.,13 found that healthcare personnel was one of the 
most-researched groups with 6%, a proportion far 
below the results from our study with 23% of the total original articles. 
In an article from Italy,
24 and in another two from 
Spain2,11 it was reported that in nursing journals 
there is progressive increase on the interest for themes related to vulnerable populations, a statement that could not be substantiated in our study, and which Nyamathi 
et al.,28 have related 
to the profession™s global commitment to improve 

health conditions of these populations and for 
the development of theoretical models to study 

vulnerability. 
Care providers, in spite of their importance, are 


published in nursing journals;29 this situation was also observed in our research, which found 

that only 2% of the total number of articles were 

dedicated to this group.This study observed that in original articles 
quantitative-type articles predominate; a 

progressive increase of qualitative-type articles 

was also noticed, which could lead to a greater 
balance between both paradigms. This agrees 
with articles on the production of nursing journals 

in Italy,
24 Spain,
2 England,19 Colombia, and 
Brazil,13 which would indicate the interest by 
nursing to approach the object of knowledge with 

the perspectives offered by diverse methodologies.
Similar to other authors,2,19,24 our study found that in quantitative articles analytical methodologies 

are not frequent, requiring strategies to promote 

these types of investigations in nursing; among 

them, the development of these types of studies as 

a degree requirement in doctoral formation,
13 and 
the requirement of professors with PhD degrees in 

the execution of research with these designs that 

better approach the search for causal relationships. 

Regarding the qualitative paradigm, ethnographic 

designs were the most frequent, coinciding with 

results from other similar articles.
 2,13The results obtained in this study permitted 



journal in its 30 years of editing, identifying in 

this publication medium the tendencies in the 

characteristics of the authors and preferences 

in the themes and target population of articles. 

It is necessary to continue the analysis of this 

production, both in the country and the region, to 

account for the efforts and progress in divulging 

knowledge generated and of the experiences in 

its implementation in nursing practice, thus, 

contributing to the development of the discipline. Invest Educ Enferm. 2013;31(3)    References 1. Urra M. Avances de la ciencia de la enfermería y

greater strength and notoriety.
1 For Nursing, the 
dissemination and use of knowledge in practice 

are necessary for growth in this profession.

comply with said purposes, it is necessary for said 

knowledge to be divulged through its publication

medium to communicate progress reached in the

of knowledge has increased notably through

of care in the world.5 The increased number of 
nursing journals has been so high
6 that in the most specialized database in the discipline, Cumulative 
Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), 
we could consult 5089 journals in April 2013.7 However, Nursing, as the young science it is, 

requires evaluating what is being published
8 to 
identify what are the study phenomena of interest 

for nursing professionals, in what populations are 

the greatest research efforts being concentrated, 



addressed.2Because of this, it is necessary to study the written 

production in journals to characterize and identify 

the tendencies in publications in Nursing, besides 

exploring its relationship with the disciplinary 

development. In Iberian America, Spain2,9-11 and Brazil4,6,12 are the countries with the highest 
interest for these types of evaluations, which is 

noted in the number of articles published on this 

theme in recent years. On the contrary, Colombia 

has very low diffusion Œ the bibliographic search

nursing journals regarding the availability and 

functionality of their web page.16 The journal object of this study, 
Investigación y 
Educación en Enfermería
 (IEE), is a publication 
from the Faculty of Nursing at Universidad de 

Antioquia whose mission is the publication of 

progress in research and education that contributes 
to the development of the discipline. This journal 

was created in 1983 due to the need to have a 
written medium in which to publish results of 

research carried out by nursing personnel.17 Over time, IEE accommodated itself to increasingly 



publications to acknowledge their quality, and 

from national and international organisms, 

leading to its indexing in COLCIENCIAS™ IBN-

0.00.071.44.037.90.019.4DiscussionIn this study of 656 articles printed in 30 years 



was observed toward the increase of manuscripts 

published annually, especially of original articles, 

which agrees with other authors
10,19 who state 
that knowledge in nursing has had exponential 

growth in recent years. The increased number of 

articles published in this journal is also due to 

three reasons: three numbers are edited per year 

since 2010, a platform is available on the web 
page for submittal and follow-up of manuscripts, 

and Œ further Œ since 2012 the journal is published 

entirely in English, which promotes receiving 

articles from any part of the world.

the articles published in IEE are from Colombia, 

followed by Brazil (11%), Mexico (5%), Chile 



year period, collaborations were received from 
Invest Educ Enferm. 2013;31(3)    12 countries, which in part agrees with Alarcón 
and Astudillo20 who reported, in an analysis of 
151 articles published between 2002 and 2005 

in Latin American nursing journals, Cuba as the 




Montoya,21 in a study of 37 nursing journals from Iberian America, conducted in 2008, who 

stated that Brazil is the country with the most 

publications. In terms of time transpired between 

article reception and approval, although IEE this 

has been reduced in the last 10 years from 11 to 

eight months, this indicator, considered a criterion 



journals, must be reduced.Moving on to the typology, the original article is 
one of the most important because it accounts to 

society of research results so that the application of 



of the target population of its study. In our journal, 

42% of the production during its 30 years was 

of original articles, a higher proportion than that 

reported by Serrano 
et al.,10 in a similar study of a 
Spanish journal where these articles reached 22%. 
During the development of the IEE journal, a 


theme reviews predominated; during the second, 

essays; and during the third, original articles. This 

is explained by the change in global tendencies in 

production and publication of knowledge in the 

last half century,
3,22 which are priorities related to 
the components of innovation and development 
for which it is essential to conduct research.Regarding the number of references, in our 
journal we observed an increasing tendency 

over time, which is related to that exposed by 

Gálvez23 when referring to the legitimacy of the 


consumption and that a direct relationship exists 



citing such; thus, it would guarantee greater and 

faster circulation of knowledge and less aging. 

care provider, a situation that is similar to that 

reported by an article comparing the production of 

a Brazilian journal to that of another Colombian 

journal,13 which commented that nurses offering 


research. Other authors10,24 state that it is the result 
of the pressure of universities on their faculty staff to 

publish research results. It is also a fact that most 

nursing journals come from academic institutions 

and few are from hospital entities. Although many 

healthcare institutions have teaching-care provider 

agreements with universities, these rarely have 

institutional policies for research,16 which explains 


is due mainly to formation institutions.25 Other 
authors8,13 remark on the need to involve care 
providing nurses in research processes, given that 

they are the ones who are frequently in contact 

with the users, thereby, they should not waste 

their valuable contributions and experience on the 

practice of care. 
With respect to the average number of authors 
per article, it was found that almost half of those 

published in IEE had one author, observing over 

time the tendency to increasing from two to three. 

The aforementioned has also been reported in 

studies in journals from Spain,
9-11 Italy,
24 and Colombia and Brazil;13 which Harande26 has interpreted as a possible direct relationship with 



research that leads to articles and which Serrano
10 has associated to the increased complexity of 

research.Revising the academic level of the authors in the 


of articles in the IEE journal have had graduate 

formation (39% masters and 21% doctorate), 

et al.,8 who also stated publications by nurses with master™s degree is higher because those with 

PhD degrees are still a minority. Díaz 
et al.,13 state that this difference may be because many 

of the authors are professors who are required 

higher academic formation to work in universities 

and, as already expressed, they have the greatest 

commitment to divulge research results.María de los Ángeles Rodríguez-arley Mateo Rojas-Minota
Invest Educ Enferm. 2013;31(3) 351
4% of the articles published in the IEE journal, a 

participation that, according to García 
et al
.,8 is 
quite limited and could be a consequence of low 

commitment in the promotion of new generations 
of researchers.Upon revising the themes of the articles, our journal 
revealed that out of every four articles one dealt 

with nursing care and another with public health. 

The aforementioned is similar to data reported 
in articles on journals from Spain,
2,10 Italy,
24 England,19 and two Latin American journals.13 Prado 
et al
.,27 found, in a study conducted with 
Brazilian and Spanish publications, that the most-addressed themes were those related to education 


that was similar in our study. A theme of emerging 
interest, like that of theories of nursing, has been 


et al.,13 a situation that could also be assumed in our study 
where only 0.5% of the articles had this topic.
Nurses were the most-frequent target population of the article (25%), followed by nursing students 

(8%). Several authors
2,19,20 have also reported that 
the volume of articles is important in which the 

target population of study are these professionals, 
revealing that it is the nursing profession is the 
self-reference of what is published. Díaz 
et al
.,13 found that healthcare personnel was one of the 
most-researched groups with 6%, a proportion far 
below the results from our study with 23% of the total original articles. 
In an article from Italy,
24 and in another two from 
Spain2,11 it was reported that in nursing journals 
there is progressive increase on the interest for themes related to vulnerable populations, a statement that could not be substantiated in our study, and which Nyamathi 
et al.,28 have related 
to the profession™s global commitment to improve 

health conditions of these populations and for 
the development of theoretical models to study 

vulnerability. 
Care providers, in spite of their importance, are 


published in nursing journals;29 this situation was also observed in our research, which found 

that only 2% of the total number of articles were 

dedicated to this group.This study observed that in original articles 
quantitative-type articles predominate; a 

progressive increase of qualitative-type articles 

was also noticed, which could lead to a greater 
balance between both paradigms. This agrees 
with articles on the production of nursing journals 

in Italy,
24 Spain,
2 England,19 Colombia, and 
Brazil,13 which would indicate the interest by 
nursing to approach the object of knowledge with 

the perspectives offered by diverse methodologies.
Similar to other authors,2,19,24 our study found that in quantitative articles analytical methodologies 

are not frequent, requiring strategies to promote 

these types of investigations in nursing; among 

them, the development of these types of studies as 

a degree requirement in doctoral formation,
13 and 
the requirement of professors with PhD degrees in 

the execution of research with these designs that 

better approach the search for causal relationships. 

Regarding the qualitative paradigm, ethnographic 

designs were the most frequent, coinciding with 

results from other similar articles.
 2,13The results obtained in this study permitted 



journal in its 30 years of editing, identifying in 

this publication medium the tendencies in the 

characteristics of the authors and preferences 

in the themes and target population of articles. 

It is necessary to continue the analysis of this 

production, both in the country and the region, to 

account for the efforts and progress in divulging 

knowledge generated and of the experiences in 

its implementation in nursing practice, thus, 

contributing to the development of the discipline. Invest Educ Enferm. 2013;31(3)    References 1. Urra M. Avances de la ciencia de la enfermería y
